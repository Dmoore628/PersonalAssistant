# ADR-0002: Neo4j for Knowledge Graph Database

## Status
**Accepted**

**Date:** 2025-01-15
**Deciders:** Data Architecture Team, Memory Agent Team
**Technical Story:** Knowledge graph implementation for contextual memory and relationship management

## Context
The Memory Agent requires a sophisticated database solution capable of:
- Storing complex entity relationships and contextual information
- Supporting role-based data segmentation for different user contexts
- Providing sub-100ms query response times for contextual retrieval
- Scaling to 10+ million entities with graph traversal capabilities
- Supporting full-text search and semantic relationships

Database options considered:
1. **Neo4j** - Native graph database with Cypher query language
2. **ArangoDB** - Multi-model database with graph capabilities
3. **PostgreSQL + Extensions** - Relational database with graph extensions
4. **Amazon Neptune** - Managed graph database service

## Decision
We selected **Neo4j Community Edition** as the knowledge graph database for the following reasons:

- **Native Graph Storage:** Purpose-built for graph data with optimized storage and traversal
- **Cypher Query Language:** Expressive and intuitive query language for complex graph patterns
- **Performance:** Excellent performance for graph traversals and relationship queries
- **APOC Procedures:** Rich library of graph algorithms and utility functions
- **Community Support:** Large community, extensive documentation, and tooling ecosystem
- **Development Experience:** Excellent browser-based query interface and visualization tools

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Query Performance:** Native graph traversal algorithms provide excellent performance
- **Expressive Queries:** Cypher makes complex relationship queries readable and maintainable
- **Relationship Modeling:** Natural representation of user contexts, memories, and relationships
- **Scalability:** Proven ability to handle millions of nodes with good performance
- **Rich Ecosystem:** APOC procedures provide advanced graph algorithms out of the box
- **Development Productivity:** Browser interface enables rapid query development and debugging

### Negative
- **Learning Curve:** Cypher query language requires training for development team
- **Memory Usage:** Graph databases can be memory-intensive for large datasets
- **Backup Complexity:** Graph database backups are more complex than relational databases
- **Single Point of Failure:** Community edition lacks high-availability features
- **Licensing Costs:** Enterprise features require commercial licensing

### Neutral
- **Data Modeling:** Requires careful schema design for optimal performance
- **Integration:** Standard Neo4j Python driver provides good integration capabilities
- **Monitoring:** Requires graph-specific monitoring and alerting approaches

## Implementation

### Configuration
- Neo4j 5.22 running in Docker container
- APOC procedures enabled for advanced graph operations
- Custom indexes on frequently queried node properties
- Role-based data segmentation using node labels and properties

### Data Model
```cypher
// Core entity types
(:Memory {id, type, properties, context_roles, confidence, created_at, updated_at})
(:Task {id, title, description, priority, status, created_at})
(:User {id, role, preferences, created_at})
(:Context {id, name, type, active_since})

// Relationship types
-[:RELATES_TO {strength, confidence}]->
-[:CREATED_BY {timestamp}]->
-[:RELEVANT_TO {context, confidence}]->
-[:SIMILAR_TO {similarity_score}]->
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Composite indexes on (type, context_roles) for filtered queries
- Full-text search indexes on memory properties
- Query result caching for frequently accessed patterns
- Connection pooling with configurable pool sizes

### Security Measures
- Authentication enabled with secure password policy
- Network access restricted to application containers
- Regular automated backups with point-in-time recovery
- Audit logging for all data modifications

## Compliance
- **REQ-KG-001:** 10+ million entities with sub-100ms query response ✅
- **REQ-KG-002:** Real-time graph updates with ACID compliance ✅
- **REQ-KG-003:** AES-256 encryption at rest (via Docker volume encryption) ✅
- **REQ-KG-004:** Role-based data segmentation and context filtering ✅
